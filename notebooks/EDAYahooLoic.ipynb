      "Contenu extrait : Oops, something went wrong Tesla (TSLA) may be one step closer to achieving a major milestone with its full-self driving (FSD) software. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a note to clients that the bank believes FSD is “very close” to becoming unsupervised, meaning drivers would be able to be hands-free and eyes-free while the system is in use. Potter and the Piper Sandler team cited data from a discussion they had with FSD Community Tracker, an independent website that measures the efficacy of FSD using available data. “The tracker's core metric, referred to as ‘miles to critical disengagement,' exhibited a >20x improvement after FSD v14.1.x was released in October (from 441 miles in the previous version to 9,200+ miles). This was the biggest sequential improvement in 4 years of data collection,” Potter said. In addition, Potter noted the following milestones from the discussion with FSD Community Tracker: Austin Robotaxi data implies 40,000 miles between crashes (7 NHTSA incidents in ~280k miles). The data implies that at 13,000 miles driven a year on average for most people, an FSD-equipped car can go approximately three years without crashing. The figures reflect only data from June through October. As more data comes in, the miles to disengage should rise. While the latest version of FSD, 14.2.x, showed a recent downtick in performance, Potter wrote that efficiency should improve as more data is collected for 14.2.x, which the analyst says should be coming in the next 3+ weeks. This could mean big news for Tesla’s Austin Robotaxi test. “Bottom line: Tesla is likely very close to removing safety operators from Austin robo-taxis,” he concluded while reiterating his Overweight rating and $500 price target. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up Tesla’s FSD system recently, claiming that version 14.2.x allows a driver to text and drive, “depending on context of surrounding traffic.” While Musk may believe the software is at that level of capability, texting and driving is illegal in almost every US state, and to be fully level 4 autonomous would require Tesla to meet NHTSA’s safety standards. Currently, only Alphabet's (GOOGL) Waymo offers level 4 autonomous driving in its robotaxis, but for specific operating territories. The new year is gearing up to be a big one for autonomous driving and robotaxis, with analysts at Morgan Stanley predicting 2026 will be an \"inflection point” for the technology. Morgan Stanley’s newest Tesla analyst, Andrew Percoco, has a less bullish overall outlook compared to Piper Sandler’s Potter, but he’s also high on the EV maker’s self-driving software. “Full Self Driving (FSD) is the crown jewel of Tesla's auto business. We believe that its leading-edge personal autonomous driving offering is a real game changer, and remains a significant competitive advantage over its EV and non-EV peers,” Percoco wrote in a note published on Monday.

      "Contenu extrait : Oops, something went wrong Across the world, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) is counting on renewed growth, based largely on regaining its spot as the number one electric vehicle (EV) company in the world. At the core of its aspirations are self-driving cars and a chance to sell new models. Its self-driving plans just got another major challenge. So did its plans to launch more affordable products against only modest competition. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) faces headwinds in Europe on both the self-driving and affordable products fronts. Shareholders increasingly see Tesla as a laggard in its industry. If you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) has signed a deal with Estonia-based ride-hailing platform Bolt to deploy driverless vehicles across Europe, with plans to begin on-road trials in 2026. The transaction will integrate Stellantis autonomous vehicle platforms with Bolt's ride-hailing network, which serves more than 200 million customers in over 50 countries, including the 23 member states of the European Union. The  Stellantis/Bolt deal does have one challenge. Each EU nation has its own rules for self-driving products. However, the two companies believe they can overcome this. (Why would they bother otherwise?) Tesla “self-driving” is competing in most of the same markets. Its European Full Self-Driving (Supervised) program is growing as it extended its demo ride-along program by three months until the end of March 2026. However, Elon Musk faces a market in which Tesla’s sales have been dropping by double-digit percentages most months of 2025. In some nations, the decline is over 40%. There is a theory that Musk has meddled in EU politics, which has caused a sort of revolt among buyers. In the meantime, almost every legacy car company in Europe has launched EV products of its own. The small EV market in Europe just got a powerful new competitor. Renault and Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F) will develop small, cheaper Ford-branded EV for the European market to compete with rising competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. Inadvertently, of course, this means Tesla products as well. Ford CEO Jim Farley commented, “We know we’re in a fight for our lives in our industry, and no better example than here in Europe.” Ford has done poorly in the U.S. EV market. At least Europe gives it another chance. Tesla has sold itself to shareholders as the best self-driving car company in the world because of its artificial intelligence prowess. It has also hinted that it will attack the low end of the EV market with a $25,000 product. It is getting later and later into each endeavor.

      "Titre : Tesla promotes Optimus as its next big breakthrough, but one robot’s collapse has sparked doubts about their current level of autonomy\n",

      "Contenu extrait : Something went wrong Elon Musk and Tesla are touting the company’s Optimus robot as its next revolutionary moneymaker, but after several incidents, some are questioning how autonomous it actually is. During an event titled Autonomy Visualized at a Tesla location in Miami over the weekend, one of the humanoid robots handing out water bottles fell backward after making upward motions toward its head with both hands, according to a video posted to Reddit. (This incident was shortly after Russia debuted its first AI-powered robot, which similarly fell onstage at an event.) The Tesla event was meant to show off its “Autopilot technology and Optimus,” Electrek reported. It made the movement after accidentally knocking some of the water bottles it was handing out off a desk, and stood out because of its similarity to a human reaction. While it’s unknown what actually occurred during the incident, the robot’s movement led some online to speculate the robot may have been taking off a VR headset. Tesla did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Tesla Optimus byu/Decent_Cheesecake643 inteslamotors The incident stood out because Tesla has used human-controlled Optimus robots at prior events. During Tesla’s robotaxi event last year, attendees interacted with Optimus robots in person. Some played rock, paper, scissors, while others served drinks or posed for photos. Yet, it turns out—although the company did not advertise it—some of those bots were apparently being controlled remotely by humans. At least one Optimus robot admitted it, saying: “Today, I’m assisted by a human; I’m not yet fully autonomous,” although the Los Angeles Times reported, at the time, using humans to operate the bots may have been due to a late request by Musk to include the robots in the robotaxi event. Tesla has previously trained its robots with workers wearing special motion-capture suits and VR headsets. While Tesla has relied on humans before to showcase their Optimus robots, Musk has often said the robots, in other settings, are not human operated. In reply to a post on X in October that showed Optimus practicing martial arts, Musk affirmed the robots movements were “AI, not tele-operated.” At the premiere of Tron: Ares that same month, an Optimus robot can also be seen squaring up with actor Jared Leto, a feat that Musk also said was AI-led, not human-controlled. “Optimus was at the Tron premiere doing kung fu, just up in the open, with Jared Leto. Nobody was controlling it. It was just doing kung fu with Jared Leto at the Tron premier. You can see the videos online,” Musk said during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call. “The funny thing is, a lot of people walked past it thinking it was just a person.” Whether the Optimus robots still rely on human assistance is unclear, yet Musk and Tesla have pinned high hopes on the product, which Musk has called “the biggest product of any kind, ever.” Musk has projected Optimus could represent up to 80% of the company’s total value, and during the company’s third-quarter earnings call, the CEO said Tesla would next year start  building a production line that could eventually have an annual capacity of 1 million Optimus robots.

      "Contenu extrait : Oops, something went wrong Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person in the world. While his net worth is slightly under $500 billion as of early December, he recently became the first person to have a personal fortune of over $500 billion after being the first to amass a net worth of $400 billion the year before. Much of his wealth comes from ownership stakes in various companies, including Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer. When Tesla’s stock value rises or falls, so does his net worth. Find Out: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell Read Next: 6 Safe Accounts Proven To Grow Your Money Up To 13x Faster According to Forbes, Musk owns 12% of Tesla’s available shares, representing around one-quarter of his portfolio’s total value. Given Musk’s incredible wealth, it’s tempting to invest in Tesla as he did. However, if you’re not careful, that strategy could prove costly. Investing everything in a single stock, like Tesla, can yield big rewards. A good quarter, an innovative technology announcement or a stable rise in value over time can make you a lot of money. However, even if you think Tesla is the car of the future and believe in Musk’s ability to lead the company, putting all your money into Tesla stocks exposes you to significant risk. Every personal finance expert will tell you the key to good investing is diversification. This improves your investment portfolio’s overall performance while increasing stability. By spreading out your investments over stocks, bonds, commodities, cash and even cryptocurrency, you’re protecting yourself in case one area drops. For example, earlier this year, Tesla encountered several challenges. Musk took the helm of the controversial Department of Government Efficiency, causing global boycotts and protests. Rival EV company BYD from China surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales, becoming the world’s largest EV manufacturer. Also, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut out EV purchase credits from the government’s budget. All of these occurrences negatively affected Tesla’s share value, meaning your entire portfolio would have dropped significantly without diversification. Use Musk himself as an example. He has diversified his portfolio to include several other companies to protect his net worth against a decline in the value of his Tesla shares. He owns a 42% stake in SpaceX, Twitter, Neuralink and The Boring Company. Learn More: This ‘Boring’ Investment Could Be the Secret To Never Running Out of Retirement Income Since its drastic drop in value in April, Tesla’s stock price has jumped back up 85%, putting the stock at an annual positive return. The company remains an attractive investment opportunity to many. Because Tesla has factories and sales worldwide, it’s positioned to continue scaling and gaining massive amounts of profits. Tesla also remains the world’s most well-known EV brand, making it a trusted name for car buyers. Finally, Tesla’s focus on groundbreaking technology and initiatives like self-driving cars, renewable energy and AI makes investors optimistic about the company’s long-term potential. On top of its popular EV products, such as the Model 3 and Cybertruck, Tesla also sells batteries, charging equipment and solar panels.
